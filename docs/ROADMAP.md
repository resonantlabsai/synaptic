# Roadmap

## Near-term
- Minimal migrations story (rebuild index from JSONL)
- Better pruning heuristics (size-aware + recency-aware)
- More examples: agent memory, project notes, knowledge-base style usage

## L2 evolution
- Stronger neighbor signals (multi-hop walks, edge decay, weighting strategies)
- Better meta-candidate scoring / dedupe

## L3 (experimental)
- Concept folding (merge atoms into meta-atoms with receipts)
- Contradiction detection (flag atoms that conflict)
- Novelty surfacing (suggest what you *aren't* remembering)
