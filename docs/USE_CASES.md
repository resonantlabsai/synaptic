# Use cases (beyond “AI memory”)

Synaptic is useful anywhere you want **persistent recall + pattern surfacing**.

- **Research notebook**: ideas, hypotheses, citations, and “what changed”
- **Project memory**: architectural decisions, tradeoffs, recurring bugs, incident timelines
- **Creative work**: themes, motifs, world-building rules, recurring characters
- **Operations**: runbooks, root causes, learned constraints, postmortem takeaways
- **Education**: spaced repetition of concepts with strength/decay dynamics
