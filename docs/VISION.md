# Vision

Synaptic is a **local, cacheable memory substrate** designed to help intelligent systems keep, retrieve, and evolve ideas over time.

## Core principles
- **Local-first**: runs without external services by default.
- **Receipts over vibes**: memory entries should preserve provenance where possible.
- **Synaptic dynamics**: use strengthens, disuse decays, pruning makes room.
- **Pattern surfacing**: neighbors + co-activation reveal bridges across concepts.

## Layer model
- **L1 (Recall)**: fast retrieval of memory atoms (FTS + lightweight similarity).
- **L2 (Neighbors)**: expand from L1 seeds using edges + similarity to discover related ideas.
- **L3 (Future, experimental)**: higher-order pattern operators (concept folding, contradiction detection, novelty surfacing).
